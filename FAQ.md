# FAQ

## Which games do you play with this?

Mostly games that lack gamepad support.  
That includes older games and many indie games.

## Any popular games?

I've played Cassette Beasts, Dead Cells and Asphalt 9 with it.

## The default mapping doesn't work for me. What do I do?

You can change the mapping in the source code and build the server yourself.  
With a bit of remapping, almost everything is playable.  
The server will eventually have a GUI for changing the mapping.

## I want to change the colour of the gamepad

Again, this is something that will be added in the future.  
I have already prepared nice alternate colours for the gamepad.

If you are can build the app yourself, you can change the primary colours in [ui/theme/Color.kt](https://github.com/kitswas/VirtualGamePad-Mobile/blob/main/app/src/main/java/io/github/kitswas/virtualgamepadmobile/ui/theme/Theme.kt).  
The app will generate tonal variations of the primary colour for the rest of the UI.

## You mentioned cool upcoming features. When will they be available?

As soon as I have time to work on it. :)  
If you want them sooner, you can _contribute to the project_.
