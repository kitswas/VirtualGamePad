# FAQ

## Which games do you play with this?

Mostly games that lack gamepad support.  
That includes older games and many indie games.

RPGs in particular are a good fit, as they often have simple controls and don't require quick reflexes.

Action games are also playable, but you better be prepared to practice.

## Any popular titles?

I've played [Ys X: Nordics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_X:_Nordics), [Cassette Beasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_Beasts) and [Dead Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Cells) with it.

## The default mapping doesn't work for me. What do I do?

You can:

1. Change the controls in-game, if the game supports it.
2. Use the profile editor in the server to remap the controls.

With a bit of remapping, almost everything is playable.  

You can find a few [sample profiles here](https://gist.github.com/kitswas/b7a100954de7dd7dcbe52cd38a27c8cf).

## You mentioned cool upcoming features. When will they be available?

As soon as I have time to work on it. :)  
If you want them sooner, you can _contribute to the project_.
