# FAQ

## Which games do you play with this?

Mostly games that lack gamepad support.  
That includes older games and many indie games.

## Any popular titles?

I've played [Cassette Beasts](https://www.cassettebeasts.com/), [Dead Cells](https://dead-cells.com/) and [Asphalt 9](https://asphaltlegends.com/) with it.

## The default mapping doesn't work for me. What do I do?

You can:

1. Change the controls in-game, if the game supports it.
2. Change the mapping in the source code and build the server yourself.

With a bit of remapping, almost everything is playable.  
~~The server will eventually have a GUI for changing the mapping.~~  
We now have partial remapping support on the server.

## You mentioned cool upcoming features. When will they be available?

As soon as I have time to work on it. :)  
If you want them sooner, you can _contribute to the project_.
