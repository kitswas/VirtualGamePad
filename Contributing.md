# Contributing to VirtualGamePad

Welcome to the VirtualGamePad project! We're building a virtual gamepad that lets you use your Android phone as a game controller for PCs, and **we need YOUR help** - whether you're a gamer or someone who just wants a better way to play games.

- this list will be replaced by the table of contents
{:toc}

## üéÆ Who We Need

**You don't need to be a programmer to help!** We especially need:

- **Gamers** who can test with real games
- **Mobile users** testing on different Android devices
- **Anyone** who finds bugs or has ideas

## üöß Project Status

**Heads up**: This project is changing fast! We're still figuring things out, so:

- Features might break between updates
- New stuff gets added regularly
- Your feedback directly shapes what we build next

Go see [the roadmap](Roadmap.md).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Expect

**The Reality:**

- I'm the only maintainer right now, so responses might take a week or two
- Things break sometimes (we're still figuring it out!)
- Your idea might not get implemented immediately
- But every bug report and suggestion helps make this better!

## üéØ Our Goal

We want VirtualGamePad to be the **easiest, lightest, most reliable way** to use your phone as a game controller. Your testing and feedback is what gets us there!

## ü§ù How YOU Can Help (No Coding Required!)

### Find and Report Bugs

*This is HUGE for us!*

- Try to break things (seriously!)
- Test with your favorite games
- Try weird button combinations
- Test on different Android devices

**How to report**: [Create an issue](https://github.com/kitswas/VirtualGamePad/issues/new/choose) and tell us:

- What you were doing
- What went wrong
- What device you're using (phone model, Android version)
- Screenshots help a lot!

### Test on Your Devices

*We can't test everything ourselves!*

- Different Android phones/tablets
- Different screen sizes
- Older Android devices
- Any games that don't work well?

### Share Ideas

- How could we make it easier to use?
- What's confusing about the current setup?
- What features would make this awesome?

### Help Others

- Answer questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/kitswas/VirtualGamePad/discussions)
- Share tips and tricks you discover
- Help other users with setup problems

### Spread the Word

- Make videos showing it working
- Post about it on gaming forums, Reddit, Discord
- Tell your friends

## üèóÔ∏è What Is VirtualGamePad?

It's actually 4 connected projects:

- **[VirtualGamePad](https://github.com/kitswas/VirtualGamePad)** - The project website and documentation

   - Steam games
   - Indie games
   - Emulators (Visual Boy Advance, RetroArch, Dolphin, etc.)
   - Browser games

3. **Child-Friendly Testing**

   - Are instructions clear enough?

## üîß For Developers

If you DO code and want to help:

### Easy Starting Points

- Fix typos in documentation
